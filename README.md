# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-Pycharm
🎮 AI Developer & Creative Technologist | 👨‍💻 Passionate about merging AI logic with interactive interfaces.

I'm a Python developer who enjoys building smart, intuitive applications with a clean user experience. From creating AI opponents in classic games like Tic Tac Toe using Minimax algorithms, to designing GUI-based applications with Tkinter and visual elements using Pillow, I aim to make AI accessible and fun.

🚀 Key Highlights:
Built a Tic Tac Toe AI game with both human-vs-AI and AI demo modes.

Integrated intelligent move decision-making via Minimax with alpha-beta pruning.

Developed a visually appealing UI with timers, match tracking, and stats.

Focused on clean code architecture and smooth game flow using Tkinter.

🔧 Tech Stack:
Python, Tkinter, Pillow

Algorithmic thinking (Minimax, game tree logic)

UX/UI design principles for desktop applications

I'm constantly exploring the intersection of AI, game logic, and user interface design.
